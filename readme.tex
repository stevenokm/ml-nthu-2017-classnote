Math inline mode:\\
A polynomial: $x^{3} + 2x^{2} + x$\\
A series: $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}$\\
$x^{2y^{3}}$ $x^{2y_{2}}$ $x^{y}_{1}$ $x_{1}^{y}$\\

Math display mode:\\
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{n^2-3n+4} = f(n)
\]
\begin{equation}
\label{myequation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}{n^2-3n+4} = f(n)
\end{equation}
